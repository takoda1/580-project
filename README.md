## Overview

The game runs in a browser and is designed to mimic the capability of online arcade to play various games in one place. Arcadia contains three games, `The Forbidden Forest`, `Clap It`, and `King of the Maze`. Our idea for this game stemmed from the need for more inclusive technology for people with disabilities. As we learned during various lectures this semester, many of the current games for people with disabilities are extremely outdated, too simple, do not contain proper accessibility features, or simply do not exist at all. 
We wanted our game to be accessible from anywhere. Therefore, we are hosting it on Heroku. The way the users play the game is by providing intuitive sound-based cues and instructions.


`The Forbidden Forest`

> The Forbidden Forest is a sound-based math game. Players will be stuck in an enchanted, forbidden forest with a monster chasing after them. They will have to 'dodge' obstacles in the forest by correctly answering basic math questions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The answers to the questions will be given in multiple choice style, with each answer corresponding to an arrow key, helping them dodge the monster. Each time they answer a question incorrectly, the monster will get closer, indicated by a louder monster sound in the background. With every correct answer, the player will get closer to successfully exiting the forest and winning the game.   

`Clap It`
> Clap It is a sound-based reaction time game. Players will be given commands as a beat plays and must react to those commands in time. The beats per minute of the beat will steadily increase as the player successfully fulfills commands, until the player messes up a command. This is an arcade style game where there is no end, only high scores. (based off bop-it)

`King of the Maze`
> King of the maze is a sound based maze game. Players will be repelled by monsters and obstacles sound cues as they navigate through the maze.

## Setup

The game is available online at [http://comp580.herokuapp.com/](http://comp580.herokuapp.com/) . This is the easiest way to access the game, especially for those without a background in computer science. 

For more advanced users who may want to play the game locally, the entire `580-project` folder may be downloaded or cloned. Once `Git Bash` has been properly installed on your computer, you may open a `Git Bash` window in the `580-project` folder and type `node server.js`. The game can then be played by going to a browser of your choice and going to the domain `localhost:8080`. 

> Command in Git Bash to play the game locally
```shell
$ node server.js
```
